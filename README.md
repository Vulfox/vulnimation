Vulnimation is meant to be an animation tool that stretches my current understanding of GPU graphics and rendering for consumption. It will probably make use of Mach and FFMPEG, but we'll see.

Currently uses Pixi's maintained copy of zgui. Gonna dive into coming up with a solution that uses Mach's ECS for GUI and see how that goes.

Note to self: assets need to be manually copied to bin dir atm. Fix this!
